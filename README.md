The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil. Its features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price, payment and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. 
# Objectives of this project
This project explores the database Olist analytically in Postgresql. This database contains various information about many perspectives of an e-commerce platform and it also presents many analytical ideas. This exploratory analysis focuses on describing the data analytically and visualizing the data using suitable tables and charts. The main objectives of this project are

* exploring tables in the database separately to gain more insights about the data in each table
* Finding proper types of visualization to present manipulated data
* Getting further insights that raw data does not show by data aggregation and calculation
* Finding relevant connections among the table so that when joined together they can show even better insights that they alone cannot present
